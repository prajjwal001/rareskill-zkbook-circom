# zk-book circom

These is my notes for the module (Circom and Constraint Design Patterns) of Rareskills zk-book.

- Currently, it's a subset of the content in the book, and I tried to note down important things that will help me in revising the same.
- I will be making it more beginner-friendly in the future.
